Project Title: finalprojectSP
Description: This is a simple SQLite Database Management Tool with a GUI, it allows us to
specifically manage data inside the table "games". It provides the following features:
View Data: This feature fetches and displays all rows from the table games. It displays
the gameID and name of the game.
Add Data: This feature allows to add new data into "games" table, specifically inserting
just the name of the game. 
Delete Data: This feature allows to delete a row we selected, deleting it from the database.
Requirements: Python 3.x; Other Libraries like tkinter and sqlite3 are required, but they are included with python
so no further installations are required. The database file "finalprojectSP_schema2.db" is required for this project
or at least a database file with the same schema as this one. 
Installation: After downloading the zip folder decompress the folder to use the project. 
Usage: To use this project open the Command prompt and go to the directory where your project file is located using
command "cd" to move across directories and command "python3 main.py" to execute the GUI. To insert new data into
the database you need to write the name of the game you want to add in the text box and then press the button "add".
To delete data from the database, just press the row you want to delete(it will highlight in blue) and then press the
delete button.
